	- Explain his personal experience with open source that clarify how can be possible, in our economy, to mantein a open source project 
## Course Overview
### What is Open Source
- Open source software is built on the premise that when many people work together, they can create something greater than the sum of its parts.
- Open source refers to a type of software whose source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute the code
### License
- For software to be considered open source, it must be released under a license that grants users the right to access
	- MIT License
	- GNU General Public License (GPL)
	- Apache License
- These License grants users the right access
### Brief History
- In the 1950s and 1960s, computer software was often bundled with hardware, and source code was freely shared among researchers and developers.
- in the 1970s and 1980s companies started to view software as a valuable asset and began to restrict access to source code
### The Birth of Free Software
- In response to the growing restrictions on software access and distribution, computer scientist Richard Stallman founded the **Free Software Foundation** (FSF) in 1985
	- promote the development and use of free software
	- which they defined as software that grants users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the code
- This concept is similar to open source but places a greater emphasis on the ethical and political aspects of software freedom
- Stallman and the FSF went on to develop the GNU Project (which stands for "GNU's Not Unix"), an ambitious effort to create a completely free and open operating system
### Linux
- 1991 Linus Torvalds developed a free and open source kernel called Linux
- When combined with the GNU system, Linux formed a complete, free, and open source operating system that is still widely used today

## Tools to be Successful
- it's essential to familiarize yourself with the tools and platforms commonly used by the community
	- Git & Github
	- Visual Studio Code
	- DIscord
## How to Contribute to Open Source
### Finding project to work on

- One of the first challenges you might face when learning how to contribute to open source is finding a project to contribute to. Here are some tips to help you discover projects that align with your interests and skills:
	
	1. **Browse GitHub and GitLab**: Both GitHub and GitLab host a vast number of open source projects. You can use their search functionality to find projects based on specific keywords, programming languages, or topics.
	    
	2. **Follow your interests**: Think about the tools, frameworks, and libraries you use or are interested in learning more about. Many of these projects are open source and welcome contributions from the community.
	    
	3. **Join open source communities**: There are numerous online communities, forums, and chat platforms dedicated to open source development. By joining these communities, you can connect with other developers, discover new projects, and find collaboration opportunities. In the [Community](https://github.com/orgs/open-sauced/discussions), for example, we share good first issues, cool GitHub projects, and issues we have open on our repositories.
	    
	4. **Leverage OpenSauced**: [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza/) is a platform that helps developers discover and contribute to open source projects. By using OpenSauced, you can find projects that align with your interests, skills, and goals.
